# Non-Scale Victories
- Didn't have my wife get me Tim Horton's for breakfast
- Didn't get a cookie with my Jimmy John's (like I normally do)
- Burned 1,100 calories playing DDR

# Food
**Breakfast**

I didn't feel like seeing if we had anything healthy for breakfast so I just ended up having 2 cups of black coffee. 

**Lunch**

- Jimmy John's #8 Roast Beef, Ham, & Provolone - no Tomato
- Jimmy John's BBQ Chips
- Aldi Fruit Snacks

**Dinner**

- Ground Beef & Potato instant pot thing (1 bowl)
- Aldi Fruit Snacks

# Activity

Today's DDR session wasn't great. I went into it with the goal of starting to PFC the 11 difficulty folder. I thought would be an easy task... It turns out, it's not. I had basically no energy and played pretty bad. Thankfully, I still got my 1,000 active calories burned. Success!
