# Non-Scale Victories

- Didn't beat myself up over a bad breakfast
- Exercised for the 2nd day in a row!
- No snacking all day

# Food
**Breakfast**

After a rough start to the morning, my will was weak and I ended up getting Tim Hortons with my wife.

- Sausage, Egg, & Cheese Croissant
- Hash Browns
- 5 or 6 Pumpkin Spice Timbits
- Black Dark Roast Coffee

**Lunch**

Trying to make up for the abysmal breakfast situation by having a small lunch.

- Cacao Soylent

**Dinner**

Not the best dinner options but I didn't blow it out so I'm calling it a victory.

- Bob Evans Meatloaf dinner
- Green beans w/ Ham
- Mashed potatoes
- 2 Dinner Rolls
- 2 Pieces of Banana Nut Bread

# Activity

DDR actually went pretty well today. I didn't play more than a couple of hard songs but I managed to play enough to burn almost 1,100 calories again and it really improved my mood!
