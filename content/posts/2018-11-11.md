# Summary

Yesterday was a cheat day and I had several bad things. Banana nut bread from tim horton's (which wasn't very good), Bawls root beer, Caniac from Raising Cane's, etc... I also didn't exercise yesterday so I didn't see much of a point in making a full post for yesterday's shenanigans.

Today I'm back on track! It's not always easy to get back on track after a 'day of poor decisions' but I've managed to do it!
