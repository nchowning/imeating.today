Welcome to imeating.today! My name is Nathan and I'll be your er... host for this journey.

I weighed myself on Saturday morning - 319.8 lbs. The scale read three hundred and 19.8 lbs. I can't say that this is the highest number that I've ever seen on the scale - that award belongs to 325.X - but it's certainly not a number that I wanted to see. I have literally gained 100+ lbs from my skinniest in ~2013.


I've struggled with my weight for as long as I can remember. In middle school and high school, I was always on the chubby side. I wasn't considered one of the "fat kids" but it was also pretty obvious that I was bigger than most of the other kids. During and after high school I tried dieting an uncountable amount of times. I'd maybe drop 5 or 10 lbs & then immediately gain it back with interest.

Toward the end of 2012, at around 285 lbs, I picked up jogging and started a strict ketogenic diet. It seemed like magic! The pounds just melted off. After a few months, I had lost around 70 lbs. The smallest number that I ever saw on the scale was 212 lbs. I hadn't been that skinny in my entire adolescent or adult life. Here's a picture from Feb 7th, 2013 of me around my skinniest. This is probably 215-220 lbs:

I had finally done it! I had figured out how to lose weight and I looked great!

Here's a picture I snapped of myself while playing DDR in my new DDR shirt that doesn't quite fit:

So what went wrong? Well, a lot has happened since then. I got a dog, got engaged, moved, switched jobs, got married, became afflicted with depression (unrelated to marriage), started several medications, switched jobs again, moved again, had a baby, etc... You get the idea. Between my skinniest and ~260 lbs, I think I just got comfortable. I had lost the weight and gotten married to a beautiful woman that loves me! I was enjoying all kinds of unhealthy meals, ice cream, etc...

Around 260 lbs is when the depression started to hit. For a while I was floating between 245 and 260. Finally I started taking an antidepressant (lexapro). It helped with the depression and anxiety but my weight started to explode. I don't even remember seeing the 270s or 280s. It seems like I just jumped from 260 to 290+ overnight.

Looking back at the weigh-ins that I managed to track, I have been around or above 300 lbs at least since Jan 2017. That's almost 2 years! I've dipped my toes into the 290s a couple of times in there, but none of them lasted long. It's really a self-perpetuating cycle. My self-esteem & self-image suffer because I'm grossly overweight. I use food as a coping mechanism so when my self-esteem suffers, I eat... Which makes me more overweight. Rinse & repeat.

2018 has been a big year for me. My wife and I welcomed a beautiful Daughter (Piper) into the world and I finally started Therapy. Mentally, I'm probably healthier than I've been in the last ~5 years but there's still a long way to go. I'm ready to kick it up a notch and finally REALLY try to fix my weight. When I lost weight before, I kept a blog (which has been lost to the ages now) and it really seemed to help keep me motivated. This is my attempt at replicating that success. I will be documenting my journey here. Wish me luck!
